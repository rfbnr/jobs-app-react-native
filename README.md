```

## Then
Run The app
```
npm start
```


Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.


```
npm run ios
```

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

```
npm run android
```

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
